## Support notes
We are shipping our templates with a very basic Vue.js configuration to let you quickly get into the development process, but we don't discourage you from using any other configuration or framework built on the top of Vue. So, please note that any request dealing with Vue (e.g. extra features, customisations, et cetera) is to be considered out of the support scope.

For more information about what support covers, please see our (FAQs)[https://cruip.com/faq/].
